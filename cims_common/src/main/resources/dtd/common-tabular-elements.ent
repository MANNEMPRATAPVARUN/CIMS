<!-- CV - January 2005
        - adding "brace" structure support
        - lowered "id ID #REQUIRED" to "id ID #IMPLIED"
          as most XML in database is now missing "id"
          (not sure how database XML edited, but doesn't 
           seem to have been with XMetal, otherwise 
           validation would have failed)
